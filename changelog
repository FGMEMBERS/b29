Added switches for nav lights and landing lights with hotspots. Also included
NASAL to drive the landing light behavior.

Minor changes to some cockpit objects in the .ac file.

Added NASAL to make the p-brake behave more realistically. You now have to depress the pedals
before putting on the brake for it to stick, and touching the brakes also turns the brake off.
