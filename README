USA TOUR CONSORTIUM, MARCH 2015
==========================================================================

The B-29 Superfortress for Flightgear has received some quick fixes and improvements on March 2015.
This work can not be considered a complete rework, but the changes make a significant progress to get the Superfortress back in the air

Before changes, JSBSim version is unable to launch, and YASim version is overall very poor in its fligth dynamic models.

Work by JWocky, and IH-COL bring a Jsbsim rework that launches, and corrects instabilities in flight. Also, a new autopilot is set that allows more stable flying.

Work by Buckaroo reworks a basic FDM that also allows a better stability in-flight.

In addition to bring the plane back in the air, this work is a good basis to progress making a Superfortress that better simulates the behavior of this aircraft.

Source code was reorganized and all textures are now converted to png (as opposed to rgb).

At the moment this airplane is under heavy develpoment. The FDM is flyable but
does not reflect the performance of the real world aircraft. The 3D model is
also incomplete. Most of the parts are there, but many animations are missing
and there is a lot of tweaking of materials, object order and grouping to be
done. Instrumentation is finally done, but clickable panels are just getting
started.

For more information see the files changelog, stuff/NOTES and stuff/TODO.
