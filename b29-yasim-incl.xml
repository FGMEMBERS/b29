      The B-29 Superfortress is a four-engine propeller-driven heavy bomber
      designed by Boeing that was flown primarily by the United States toward the
      end of World War II and during the Korean War. It was one of the largest
      aircraft to have seen service during World War II and a very advanced bomber 
      for its time, with features such as a pressurized cabin
      and an electronic fire-control system.
