YASim aerodynamic model for a Boeing b29 Superfortress

The reference datum for measurements is the nose.

Author: Gary "Buckaroo" Neely

This is a near total re-write of the original FDM by Vivian Meazza.

The primary purpose of this revision is to make the aircraft reasonably flyable and handle like an aircraft in its class. I spent only two or three hours researching the aircraft's basic characteristics, so this should not be regarded as an accurate B-29 simulation.

This revision includes significant changes to wing geometry, surface and control values, tweaks to power curves, propeller governor, and weight and balance. It also addresses an axis sign problem that had bomb weights set forward of the aircraft's nose.

Cruise settings and propeller/engine values are a compromise between actual performance as given in the flight manual and making YASim play nice. The weight and geometry of the aircraft are such that YASim thinks the aircraft is under-powered, so much had to be tweaked to avoid a high YASim "Lift Ratio". As usual with my efforts, "cruise" represents stall and flat-out max performance. "Approach" is set such that stall at the default load with full flaps occurs at around 105 Kts indicated, which is about right according to the flight manual. Stall without flaps is a little lower than the real thing but less of an issue. Note that to get the max performance indicated by this FDM, engine "boost" (turbochargers) would be set to the maximum position of 1. The default boost settings in "b29-common.xml" are 0.8, which is correct for normal procedures according to the flight manual.

Stall recovery: push the nose down, regain airspeed, then introduce power.
Landing: approach about 25 knots above stall.

CG limits are 24% and 34% MAC for most conditions. I'm using the flight manual's recommended 25% for general Weight and Balance. This required shifting the wing slightly forward to make YASim moment forces cooperate. 

Before engaging the autopilot be certain that the aircraft is in reasonably level flight and at reasonable cruise speeds. If this is not done, the aircraft may indulge itself in extreme pitch oscillations. I'm not sure why; the elevator is not particularly sensitive except at speeds approaching Vne. This can likely be resolved by a custom AP, but I had no trouble using the AP when flying the aircraft as it is intended to be flown.

  <!--
  Engine properties represent a somewhat later generation R-3350. This is necessary in part
  due to YASim viewing the aicraft as underpowered.
  Engine (not prop) RPM should idle no less than 700 RPM.
  Cruise settings represent about 65% power. Cruise speed tweaked to get YASim to cooperate.
  Turbo multiplier set according to Vivian's original value. This might have to be changed
  according to flight test and manifold pressure results, but right now I'm leaving it as-is.
  Boost settings for the FDM use the max value of 1, but values above 0.8 are for emergency power only.
